# Incident Response Simulation

### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example-video-link)

## Description
This project simulates an incident response scenario, demonstrating the detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures for a cybersecurity incident. The simulation is designed to test and improve the incident response plan and team's readiness.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Kali Linux**: For launching simulated attacks.
- **Splunk**: For log analysis and incident detection.
- **Wireshark**: For network traffic analysis.
- **Metasploit**: For exploitation and attack simulation.
- **Operating Systems**: Windows Server, Ubuntu.

## Environment Setup
- **Target Environment**: A virtual network with multiple virtual machines running various services.
- **Attack Environment**: A dedicated Kali Linux machine used to simulate attacks.

## Project Steps

### 1. Detection
Using Splunk to monitor and detect suspicious activities in the network.

### 2. Analysis
Analyzing the detected incidents using Splunk and Wireshark to understand the nature and scope of the attack.

### 3. Containment
Isolating affected systems to prevent the spread of the attack.

### 4. Eradication
Removing the root cause of the incident and ensuring no backdoors or malware remain.

### 5. Recovery
Restoring affected systems to normal operation and verifying their integrity.

### 6. Post-Incident Review
Conducting a review of the incident response to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement.
